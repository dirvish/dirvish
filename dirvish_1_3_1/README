Version 1.3.1 is experimental.  It may eat your babies.  I've got it running
on a redundant backup server, though my main backup server is still running
version 1.2.1 .

Before you can do anything else, you will need Module::Build for
Perl.  You can get it with:

perl -MCPAN -e shell      # if you haven't run CPAN before, expect lots of questions
 cpan>  install Module::Build    
 cpan>  install POSIX                   # may already be installed
 cpan>  install Getopt::Long            # may already be installed
 cpan>  install Time::ParseDate
 cpan>  install Time::Period


Module::Build changes permissions of the Build.PL file.  Fix it with
   chmod 755 Build.PL

Then you can start the build with 
    ./Build.PL

Look in the comments in Build.PL or INSTALL.pod for more information.
This will get a lot cleaner on the 1.4 production release.


Notes:  ----

I have refactored all the subroutines into DirvishHack.pm .  I added
a few subs to get rid of the anonymous subs in options, and a routine
that incorporates the common code for loading the master.conf file, and
another routine that initializes the %$Options hash.   I am not yet
initializing *everything* in the hash, but I think that might be a
good move, depending on what we learn while building test harnesses.

I combined the imsort subroutines from both dirvish-expire and
dirvish-locate.  This may not be kosher.
