These files are not yet tested or executable.  They will be someday,
but they will need more work.  Most importantly, I want to fix these
things:

1)  There is a ChmodOnExpire fix described on the Wiki.  It makes use
    of the "X" flag for GNU chmod.  The dirvish backup system will be
    used on Macs and BSD and Solaris and ... .  I do not want to use
    any features that are not on all these machines (and testable as
    well).

    I would like to see this whole section reworked;  I do not like
    using system calls when there is a Perl equivalent.  Please look
    through CPAN for appropriate modules that do the same thing.  
    That is more efficient, and more portable, and more readable.

2)  The install is WAY broken.  I refactored the contents of loadconfig.pl
    into the library dirvishlib.pl, and sucked in all other subroutines
    as well.  Now, I would like to use MakeMaker and Makefile.pl to
    do installs the "standard Perl way".  

    The install should set $CONFDIR in dirvishlib.pl . 

    Eventually, the install should also do testing.

3)  I want to add a test for an environment variable for the master
    configuration file in load_master_config ;  this should override
    $CONFDIR .

4)  I want to replace most all the tabs with 3 spaces.  I like some
    indent, but a whole tab is too much in most places.  However, I
    do NOT want to do a simple global replace;  It is important that
    things are readable and comments line up, for example.  Whichever
    way we go, everything should look the same.

5)  It is possible to embed pod in the programs.  This might be a good
    place for design notes.

6)  I want a heck of a lot more documentation on how this thing works.

7)  I want subversion tags for version numbers.

8)  CHANGELOG, INSTALL, TODO.pod, RELEASE.pod, and FAQ.pod all need
    some rework.  I also want a design document.

MORE LATER


Notes:

I have refactored all the subroutines into dirvishlib.pl .  We may
want to make a package out of this instead.   I added a few subs
to get rid of the anonymous subs in options, and a routine that
incorporates the common code for loading the master.conf file, and
another routine that initializes the %$Options hash.   I am not yet
initializing *everything* in the hash, but I think that might be a
good move, depending on what we learn while building test harnesses.

I combined the imsort subroutines from both dirvish-expire and
dirvish-locate.  This may not be kosher.
